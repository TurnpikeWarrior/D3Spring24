# Final Project

# <p style="text-align: center;">Asian Pacific American Heritage Month</p> 

### Brief Abstract
The Asian American demographic is becoming the fastest growing racial group in the United States. While the Asian population represents about 5.6% of the total American population, or about 20 million people, it has grown 102% since 2000. This also means the number of Asian American voters and eligible voters are on the rise. Unsurprinsingly, California accounts for the largest Asian American population in the lower 48 states (aka Lower 48). 

This project will delve into a detailed analysis of the Asian American population. We will examine the number of immigrants, ethnic groups, and naturalized citizens. This analysis will provide a nuanced understanding of the diverse Asian American community and the influence on American elections.
